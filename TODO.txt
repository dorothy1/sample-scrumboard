Sidebar on dashboard:
  start date
  end date
  show what people are currently working on
  create new task on story
  set one developer as responsible for all tasks on story

Scrumboard
  nicer design
  click to toggle visibility of responsible
  edit task (responsible, time left)
  create new task on story
  
  after dragging: Reload card html with data from server (hrs left may have changed)
  change border-bottom on h3 to match the card colour
  'view notes' link on each card if it has notes
  
  show stories in a right hand column

Overall
  sort of keep track of state. Mark dashboard/scrumboard as 'dirty' if changes has been made and reload automatically when switching views
