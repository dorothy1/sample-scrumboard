Sidebar on dashboard:
  start date
  end date
  days left
  burn rate (original one based on estimates)
  show what people are currently working on
  create new task on story
  set one developer as responsible for all tasks on story

Scrumboard
  nicer design
  more solid drag-and-drop
  don't expand, show all data always
  edit task (responsible, time left)
  create new task on story
  Show list of developers along with the product owner

Overall
  sort of keep track of state. Mark dashboard/scrumboard as 'dirty' if changes has been made and reload automatically when switching views
